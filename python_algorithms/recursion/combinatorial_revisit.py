## Sequences with Replacement
## Write a program that prints all sequences of length n composed
## of the numbers 1..k, i.e., k**n sequences in total
## e.g., 1, 2, 3, n = 2, generates 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 33
def sequences(nums, n):
    nums = set(nums)
    if n == 1:
        return [(i, ) for i in nums]
    else:
        return [(i, ) + s
        for i in nums
        for s in sequences(nums, n-1)]

        
## Permutations
## write a program that prints all permutations of 1..k of length n
## e.g., for 1..3, n = 2, generates 12, 13, 21, 23, 31, 32
def all_permutations(nums, n):
    if n == 1:
        return [(i, ) for i in nums]
    else:
        return [
            (i, ) + s
            for i in nums
            for s in all_permutations(set(nums)-set([i]), n-1)
        ]

## Binary strings -- SUBSET PROBLEM
## Print all sequences of length n that contain k ones and n-k zeros
## Each with once
## e.g., n = 3, k = 1 : 100, 010, 001
## e.g., n = 4, k = 2 : 1100, 1010, 1001, 0110, 0101, 0011
## Inspiration: A natural recurrence could be 
## C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k) 
## where first term corresponds to prefix1 and second prefix0
## But the problem is, the complexity of this recurrence is very high 
def ones_zeros(n1, n0):
    if n1 == 0:
        return [tuple(0 for _ in range(n0))]

        prefix0 = [(0,) + s for s in ones_zeros(n1, n0-1)]
        return prefix1 + prefix0
        
## Partitioning
## Generate all representations of a given positive integer n
## as the sum of a non-increasing sequence of positive integers
## e.g., n = 3, output: 3, 21, 12, 111
## e.g., n = 4, output: 4, 31, 22, 211, 13, 121, 112, 1111
def partition(n):
    if n == 1:

    else:

            (i, ) + s
            for i in range(1, n)
            for s in partition(n-i)

## Topological sorting (Dependency Graph)
## A directed graph without a cycle: An arrow from A -> B means there is 
## an dependency for A on B. Put the graph vertices in such an order
## that the end of any arrow preceds its beginning.
## Write a program that performs a topological sort in time O(n+m), 
## where n is # of vertices and m is the # of edges.
## e.g. for graph 
## 1 <- 2 <-
##           5 <- 6
## 3 <- 4 <-
## The order will be either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
## OR 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 6 OR 132456

        (u, vs.difference(freevertexes)) 
        for (u, vs) in g.items() 
        if u not in freevertexes)
    return freevertexes + topological_sort(subg)

## Connected Component of Undirected Graph
## The connected component of a vertex in a undirected graph
## is the set of all vertices that are reachable from the vertex
## via edges.
## Given an undirected graph and a certain vertex, write an algorithm
## that prints the connected component of the vertex. Each vertex in 
## the component should only be printed once. The complexity of the algorithm
## should be O(n+m) where n and m are numbers of vertexes and edges.
## To make the representation compact, here the undirected graph
## is represented by the tuple(set_of_vertices, set_of_edge_pairs)
## THIS IMPLMENTATION IS BASED ON ITERATIVE BACKTRACKING FRAMEWORK
## INSTEAD OF RECURSION, BECAUSE I THINK THE ITERATIVE FRAMEWORK
## IS MORE FLEXIBLE AS IT AVOIDS RECUSION_DEPTH_LIMIT.
## THE RECURSION VERSION SHOULD BE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD.

                        if u+v in edges 
                        or v+u in edges]

## Quick sort
def quick_sort(seq):
    if len(seq) <= 1:
        return seq
    else:
        pivot = seq[0]
        left, right = [], []
        for n in seq[1:]:
            if n <= pivot: 
                left.append(n)
            else:
                right.append(n)
        return quick_sort(left) + [pivot] + quick_sort(right)

## Selection Algorithm: K-Percentile
## n integers, find the k-th element of them in ascending order
## using O(n) complexity
## AHA: sorting them takes O(nlogn)
## Naive algorithm could take O(nk) by keeping the kth smallest numbers
## O(n) basically means going through elements only constant times
## we know finding min or max needs O(n) time
## SOLUTION: Median of Medians algorithm with magic number 5
def kth_element(seq, k):
    ## 1. separate array into n/5 groups, each containing 5 elements
    ## TODO
