Heuristics For Algorithm Problems:
(1) Horizontal Thinking 
	- Find the type of the problem (combination, sort, traversal, etc)
	- Use routines (search routine for backtracking, loop routine for combinatorial problems)
(2) Vertical Thinking 
	- Analyze specific instances to find patterns (hint for horizontal thinking)
	- Recursion
	- Divide and Conquer / Decrease and Conquer
	- Sort
