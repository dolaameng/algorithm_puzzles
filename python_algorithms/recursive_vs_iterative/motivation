Recursion is functionally equivalent to loops. But recursion could result in very
intuitive and simple solutions. However, there is also a point of translating some
recursion implementations into iterative ones based on loops. The main motivations
are: (1) avoid recursion depth limit in some languages (2) make the implementation
more flexible and fast (3) elimination of recursion could be very instructive to
programmers. 

Apart from elimination of recursions, there are also some other techniques that can
generally make recursion run faster, such as memoization, tail recursion, and etc.

Another alternative for recursion is BACKTRACKING -- including using either a queue or a stack
