It is convenient to describe algorithms using appropriate data types. Basically, 
a data type is a set of values (permissible for the variables of this type) and 
a list of allowed operations. Data types are important since they separate two 
aspects: (1) what kind of information we want to keep and what we want to do with
it and (2) how this information is represented in our program, and, ultimately,
in the computer's memory.

This package covers algorithmic exercises of stacks, queues, sets, and priority queues.
