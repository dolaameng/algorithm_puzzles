## Queue: FIFO
## In python, Queue can be simulated by (1) a list using insert(0, item) and pop()
## (2) a list using append() and pop(0) or (3) collections.deque
## It should not be a superise that queue is widely used in graph traversal algorithms

## Factorization
## Print in ascending order the first n positive integers whose
## factorization contains only the factors 2, 3, and 5.
## e.g. n = 10, ints: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15

## Inspirations: It is similiar to a tree-search problem
## in the sense that partial solutions are solutions
## and they are extended to get new solutions. So In general
## the tree-search (backtracking) can be used for the problem.
## HOWEVER, notice the factors (possible extensions) for the 
## partial solution are always fixed. So instead of using 
## one frontier queue, several queues (several frontiers) can be used so that
## the SORTING of the frontier is not necessary

## Euler Cycle
## Suppose a directed graph satisifies two requirements:
## (1) it is connected, i.e., there is a path from any given 
## vertex to any other
## (2) for any vertex the number of incoming edges is equal
## to the number of outgoing edges. 
## NOTE THESE CONDITIONS ARE SUFFICIENT BUT NOT NECESSARY 
## for Euler PATH (not Euler Cycle)
## SEE TEST CASE FOR g2 BELOW
## Find an EDGE CYCLE that traverses each edge exactly ONCE.
## GRAPH is represented as a dict of node -> [node]
## So it is iterable through all vertices and through all edges
## for a certain starting node
## e.g., for fully connected graph with 3 vertices a, b, c
## a possible path could be a permutation of: (ab, bc, ca, ac, cb, ba)
## e.g., for simple linearly connected graph a->b->c->a
## the cycle will be permutations of (ab, bc, ca)
## e.g., for simple linearly connected graph a->b->c
## there is no euler cycle, but the euler path will be permutations of (ab, bc, ca)
## NO BACKTRACKING NEEDED
