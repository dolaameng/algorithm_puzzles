## Catalan sequences and Catalan numbers
## generate all sequences of length 2n, composed of 1s and -1s,
## satisfying the following conditions a) the sum of all terms is 0
## b) the sum of any prefix is nonnegative.
## the number of such sequences is called Catalan number.
## n = 2: ++--, +-+-
## n = 3: +++---, ++-+--, ++--+-, +-+-+-, +-++--
